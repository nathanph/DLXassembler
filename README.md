DLXassembler
============

A python assembler for the DLX instruction set.

## Running Assembler.py (the cool way)
Within this project you will find a Vagrantfile and Cheffile. These two files together along with the right software can
 be used to automatically generate a virtual machine. This virtual machine is configured to run Assembler.py.
